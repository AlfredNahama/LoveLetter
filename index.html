		<h1>Hi</h1>
		<p>Despite being a quiet person, I am not particularly adept at verbally expressing my emotions. I seem to get shy easily and find myself speechless even before I begin.
But now I want to talk to you. and I've come to the conclusion that the more I see you, the more I want to be with you. I am drawn to you by a strong pull that I can't withstand because you are like a beacon of light in a starless night.
my thoughts are constantly on you, and I have fairly empty days. I'm looking forward to our upcoming meeting. 
You are the object of my insatiable love. Similar to how a flame sacrifices itself to provide light in gloom,
it consumes and beats solely to rain love for you. The main difference is that I like you deep in my heart.
But if there is someone on your heart right now, you don't need to take this seriously. Honestly I don't want you to know that my feelings are truely existed.
I don't wanna ruin your inner peace. I just wanna see you succeed and reach your goals in life. 

May the afternoon be as special as you are in every way, Have a wonderful time Mary Grace.
